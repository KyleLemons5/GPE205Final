# GPE205Final

This is a first person shooter I made for my Gameplay Programming Concepts final

I got very sick at the end of the semester when I was making this, so it is very unpolished and more of a tech demo than a full game.

Features:
1. Bullet momentum affects the player: shooting pushes the player back when the player is in the air.
2. Random enemy types: The enemies are randomly spawned in from a list, with each enemy type having a different personality.
